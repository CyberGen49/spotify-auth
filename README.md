# spotify-auth
A GitHub Pages project for getting your access and refresh tokens to use with the Spotify API. This is perfect for embedded apps that can't function as OAuth2 endpoints but that can still make web requests to refresh tokens.

Use the tool at https://spotifyauth.cybah.me or https://cybergen49.github.io/spotify-auth.
